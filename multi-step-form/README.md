# Multi step Form using React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit

A robust multi step form application built using React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. This project demonstrates form state management, asynchronous actions on submit with Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk`, custom styling from scratch, and form validation using Yup.

## Features

- **React & TypeScript**: Component-based architecture with strong type checking.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Efficient state management for form data.
- **AsyncThunk**: Handles asynchronous operations during form submission.
- **Custom Styling**: Styled from scratch to ensure uniqueness and compatibility.
- **Yup**: Advanced object schema validation and parsing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= v14.0.0)
- npm (>= v6.0.0)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ksoban20/react-codes.git
cd multi-step-form
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Navigate through the form using the "Next" and "Back" buttons.
2. Input data in each step of the form.
3. Validate the data with Yup.
4. On the final step, click "Submit". This will trigger an asynchronous action using `createAsyncThunk` to process the form submission.
